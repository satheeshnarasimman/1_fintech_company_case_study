* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Investment performance is inextricably linked with the performance of the economy. Thus when considering investment management, on a broader scope, the economy also needs to be accounted for. The following were some of the developments in the domain since 2010.
 
> Since the 2nd World War, the 2010s decade produced the 4th highest return of US Financial assets, with the stocks annually averaging 13.2% in comparison with the overall average, while the annual return on bonds was 7.4%. 

> The economy underwent a period of resurrection following the great recession in late 2000s, due to the adoption of radical monetary and fiscal policy. As of Dec 2019, it was the longest bull market ever, for 129 months.

> The Federal Reserve bought Billions of Dollars worth of US Treasury and Mortgage bonds to boost the economy, also called Quantitative Easing (QE), resulting in the coffers of banks and investors getting filled. 

> That money was available to be loaned out and purchase stocks, real estate, etc. and ultimately made it cheap for the corporations to borrow money.

> The flash crash on May 6 2010 engendered the creation of market ‘circuit breakers’ to momentarily disable trading stocks when its value drops 10% or higher within 5 minutes.

> After recovering from the 2008-09 recession, in 2013, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial shot past their maximum mark before the recession.

> The Federal Reserve aggressively acquired US bonds al the way from late 2008 until late 2014 providing further stimulus to the economy. 

> Due to the slowdown in late 2015 and early 2016, 8% of the stock market was old off. However, the economy rallied with the enactment of China’s regulatory reforms and economic stimuli. With the growth, the interest rates were hiked by the Fed 4 times between Dec 2016 and 2017.

> With the introduction Tax cuts and Jobs act, the corporate tax was slashed from 35% to 21%, and corporate Americas’s after-tax earnings peaked.

> The liquidity of the economy was slowed in 2018 because of the Fed’s reselling of bonds, coupled with four interest rate hikes of 0.25% in 2018. Consequently, 20% of the stock market value was sold off in the 4th quarter of 2018.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
 
> Sharpe Ratio – “Measures return/risk. Return is the numerator and is defined as the incremental average return of an investment over the risk free rate. Rate is the denominator and is defined as the standard deviation of the investment returns”.
 
> Sortino Ratio – “Measures return/risk. Return is the numerator and is defined as the incremental compound average period return over a Minimum Acceptable Return (MAR). Risk is the denominator and is defined as the Downside Deviation below a Minimum Acceptable Return (MAR)”.
 
> Sterling Ratio – Average Annual Return / Maximum Drawdown
 
> Beta – “A measure of the hedge fund’s volatility, or systematic risk, compared to the market as a whole. A beta of 1 indicates the fund will move with the market. A beta of more than 1 means that the fund is more volatile than the market. A beta of less than 1 means the state of the market does not have as much impact on the fund”.
 
> Skewness – “Describes a hedge fund’s asymmetry in relation to a normal distribution”.
 
> Kurtosis – “Describes trends in charts. A high kurtosis means the chart has fat tails and a low, even distribution. A low kurtosis means the chart has skinny tails and a distribution concentrated toward the mean”.
 
> Covariance – “measures the degree in which asset returns move in correlation to each other. A positive covariance means that asset returns move together, while a negative covariance means that asset returns move in the opposite direction of each other”.
 
> Standard Deviation – “Used to measure the fund’s volatility. Also known as the historical volatility”.
 
> Treynor Ratio – “A risk-adjusted measure of return based on systematic risk. It is similar to the Sharpe ratio, with the difference being that the Treynor ratio uses beta as the measurement of volatility”.
 
> Calmar Ratio– “A ratio used to determine return relative to drawdown risk in a hedge fund. Usually, the higher the ratio, the better”.
 
> R – “Also called the linear correlation coefficient, r measures the strength and director of a linear relationship between two variables”.
 
> R2 – “A statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund or security’s movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index”.
 
> Alpha – “Represents the value that the Portfolio Managers either adds to or subtracts from the fund. A positive alpha of 1% means the fund has outperformed its benchmark index by 1%. A negative alpha indicates an underperformance of 1%”.
 
> Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) – “The year over year growth rate of the hedge fund. The CAGR is not the actual return, but rather a number that portrays what the fund would have grown at if it grew at a steady rate”.
 
> Loss Deviation – “Standard deviation of a down month”.
 
> Growth of 1000 – “Tracks the monthly performance of a hypothetical $1000 investment”.
 
> Downside Deviation – “Measures left tail risk, but gives an acceptable threshold of return”.
 
> Maximum Drawdown – “The % decrease in investment value from its peak to its trough. It is the largest drawdown that has ever occurred within a specific time frame”.
 
> Fund Cumulative Returns vs. Benchmark – “Comparing the hedge funds cumulative return with a standard in the industry”.
 
> Rolling Performance – “Performance of the fund for the past 12 months”.
 
Almost all of the information for the above metrics were not found in the company’s 2019 Financial Statement. 
From the publicly available information, the fund’s cumulative return (according to Forbes) was 19.4% in 2019, which completely crushed the industry average of 7% in 2019 (Source: Marketwatch). Thus the performance of the company was exceptional.
 
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

## Recommendations
 
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I believe, the biggest financial asset the company has not tapped into is Cryptocurrency. Citadel, being one of the most powerful hedge funds, would dominate the game and gobble the other players.
 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

The value of Bitcoin is predicted for a promising growth in the forthcoming years. With its cutting edge technology and brilliant traders, Citadel will generate superior returns on this asset.
 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Bitcoin/ Cryptocurrency wallet
 
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Cryptocurrencies cannot be stored without an appropriate wallet.
